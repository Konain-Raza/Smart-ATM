This project, developed using C++ CLI (.NET Framework) in Visual Studio, provides users with secure access to their bank accounts, allowing them to withdraw money, view transaction history, and more.

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Users can securely authenticate themselves by entering their credit card number. Authentication is enhanced with additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
